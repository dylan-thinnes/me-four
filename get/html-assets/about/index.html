        Hello, my name is Dylan! I'm currently studying Computer Science at the
        University of Edinburgh, welcome to my website. I'm very passionate
        about technology's capacity to connect and to inform people. It's no
        surprise then that I do a good deal of front-end, though I'm not at all
        averse to stricter back-end work.

    <b class='text'>About the Site</b><br/>
    <small>
        I wanted to make a site that prioritizes having a very small footprint,
        yet still looks nice and behaves like a single page app, and can
        gracefully drop back if JavaScript is disabled. I think I succeeded in
        that respect.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        - When Javascript is disabled, links to different endpoints call
        prerendered static assets that are identical to what would be
        dynamically loaded if JS were enabled.
        <br/>
        - Aside from content and profile picture, the server sends less than 5
        kilobytes over the network after assets are minified and compressed.
        <br/>
        - When Javascript is enabled, it takes over regular link behaviour and
        uses XHR and the History API instead, loading only the content you need.
