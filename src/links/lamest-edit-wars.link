Lamest Edit Wars

This page summarizes some of the funniest and longest-running "edit wars" on
Wikipedia, a situation in which two (or more) people keep editing the same
pages to disagree with one another recounting of events. I suppose it's a
record which proves that even in the most hallowed halls of community, there is
still the obscenely petty and the sourest of grapes. Enjoy!
