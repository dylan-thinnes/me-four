We Will All Go Together When We Go - Tom Lehrer

Tom Lehrer is a mathematician & musical satirist who was active in the 50s &
60s. 
<br/><br/>
He has so many great songs that it's hard to choose, but I've settled for
"We Will All Go Together When We Go", an uplifting celebration of nuclear
holocaust.
