Peter Watts's Shorts & Backlist

Peter Watts is the harshest, bleakest scifi author I've ever read. He
especially loves beating you over the head with your general insignificance on
a cosmic scale and your eventual obsolescence as we enter the century of
singularities & killer robots. Good stuff!
<br/><br/>
This is a backlist he keeps of some of his works and short stories, free to
read! I particularly enjoyed "The Island", for which he won the Hugo Award.
